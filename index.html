                <h3><b>Redefining Small Business Management</b></h3>
                <p class="justify-text">At Juxi, we recognize the multifaceted roles small business owners juggle daily. From marketing and human resources to financial management and IT, the demands are endless, and the stakes are high. We also understand that the operating costs for small businesses often preclude the ability of hiring of specialized C-suite executives, such as CMOs, CSOs, CFOs, and CIOs. 
                    That is where Juxi fills the gap for small business owners, so that they can ideate and collaborate with their own AI C-Suite Executives.</p>
